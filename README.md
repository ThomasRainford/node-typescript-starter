# Node-TypeScript Starter

Super lightweight node-typescript starter with no added dependecies on top of the required TypeScript dependencies.

## Features
- Continously watches .ts files for changes and converts them to JavaScript in a seperate file.
- Uses nodemon to run the index.js file.
- ESLint with recommended linting rules for TypeScript.
- VSCode setting for running linting command when a file is saved.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomasRainford/node-typescript-starter.git
cd node-typescript-starter
```

### Step 2: Install the dependencies using yarn.

```bash
yarn
```

### Step 3: Watch the .ts files.

```bash
yarn watch
```

### Step 4: Launch in dev mode.

```bash
yarn dev
```

The .ts files will be compiled to JavaScript and placed in the dist directory. Nodemon will then run the project using the index.js file.

**Note:** Step 3 and step 4 will need to be run in seperate terminals.

## Next Steps

-  After dev mode is launched you're good to go!
-  Checkout all scripts below.
-  If you wish to add more linting rules, these can be added to the .eslintrc.js file.
-  Feel free to open issues.

## All Scripts

-  `yarn watch` -- Watches the .ts files and compiles them into javascript.
-  `yarn dev`   -- Runs the project in developer mode. This means any changes made will automatically re-run the typescript code.
-  `yarn start` -- Runs the project using Node instead of nodemon.
-  `yarn lint`  -- Runs ESLint
